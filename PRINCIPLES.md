# The Principles ("set in stone")

## The Trinity
- `|` (*OR*, fork)-- a Universal, most abstract and general Algebraic Sum Type
- `,` (*AND*, join) -- a Universal, most abstract and general Algebraic Product Type
- `->` (*IMPLY*, step) - a Universal, most abstract and general Step (in a particular direction)

## The homage to mathematical notation
- `_`  (juxtaposition) -- function application. The finest structural element of any written human language. This is also "naturally" denotes Partial Application.
- `=` (the equal sign) -- an immutable binding. We are not Platonists -- not mere ideas in a vacuum. The notion of an persistent **Environment** is necessary.
- `suchThat` (a keyword) -- denotes a refinement -- nested predicates, as in the classic Set-comprehension notation
- `where` (a keyword) -- denotes a nested set of bindings, which implicitly defines terms before they are being used.
- `let` (a keyword) -- reduces cognitive burden by uniformly unifying all the binding sites.
- `with` (a keyword) -- a better 'word' to denote the Universal **Set Union** operation (at the level of abstract interfaces)
- `'` (single quote) -- a prime, as in `let f' = ... in ...`

## The Class-instance, Trait-impl dillema
- `class` (a keyword) -- the original Haskell notation for Wadler's **Type-Classes**. All consistent with the language of Predicate Logic.
- `instance` (a keyword) -- denotes a particualr instance of a given class. This one is simply beautiful.
- `trait` + `impl` -- decoupled from the implicit notion of a rigid class hierarchy (The **Set-Subset** relation) to a **Set-Union** operation.

## Advanced Syntactic forms
- `:` (colon) -- type annotation. Universal, after any expression (Evetything is an expression).
- `...` (triple dot) -- and so on
- `1..5` (standard range notation)

## Imperarive syntactic forms
- `{}` (curly braces) -- imperative blocks
- `;` (semicolon) -- imperative explicit delimiter
- `:=` (colon-equal) -- imperative assignment (a destructive over-write)
